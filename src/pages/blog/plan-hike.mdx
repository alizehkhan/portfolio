# How I plan a hike

*Planning your first long distance hike can be an intimidatingly long process but after completing this you'll find it's significantly easier to plan your next adventures. After a couple of years of hiking, I've figured out my own rhythm when planning a multi-day hike so I thought I'd share my process in case it helps anyone out, new or experienced.*

---

## 1. Pick a route

The route is the first and most important choice I make. Once I've figured this out the rest of the planning falls easily around it.

### üá™üá∫ I usually pick a waymarked trail in Europe for a couple of reasons:

- Navigation is much easier on a waymarked trail. For example on GR trails I only need to look out for the red and white stripes to know I'm heading in the right direction.

- If it's a popular trail there will be heaps of information, blogs and dedicated facebook groups with people who have either hiked, are currently hiking or plan to hike the trail that I can ask questions to. This makes it super easy to plan for.

- It's cheaper and easier for me to travel to a trail in Europe, since I'm based here.

- I find resupply is much easier in Europe, especially on popular trails. Because it's densely populated, it's rare to be more than 25 miles or so from the nearest village or refuge serving food.

### üëÄ When picking a trail, I consider the following:

- **Is food and water available along the trail?** I don't like having to carry more than 3/4 days worth of food at any point, as my pack becomes too heavy for me to enjoy the hike. There's also more discipline and planning required.

- **What's the camping scene like?** In terms of sleeping arrangements I like to wild camp or bivouac, with the option to stay at a campsite to shower and recharge my phone every couple of days.

- **What's the weather like?** Is there a lot of snow / rain I need to prepare or carry extra gear for like crampons or gaiters?

- **Is the trail at least 10 days long?** I prefer hikes that are at least this long as I get to really immerse myself in nature and disconnect.

### üí° For route ideas:

- I sometimes have a country or mountain range in mind and research popular waymarked trails around there.

- I sometimes ask for recommendations on the hiking groups I'm a member of on **Facebook**. The hiking community is awesome. We love sharing each others adventures and learnings. Here are a couple I'm a part of: [GR10, GR11 and HRP](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1671391736504649), [GR54](https://www.facebook.com/groups/EcrinsGR54), [Walker's Haute Route](https://www.facebook.com/groups/walkershauteroute), [Long Distance Hiking in Europe](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1758402431125086).

- Sometimes I'm inspired by a hike completed by an influencer I follow on **YouTube** such as [Kraig Adams](https://www.youtube.com/@kraigadams/videos) or [Chase Mountains](https://www.youtube.com/@ChaseMountains).

## 2. Identify resupply points and places to camp

Once I've decided which trail I want to do, I need to figure out how I can roughly split it up. For this, I need to identify resupply points and places to camp.

![Wild camping in the Pyrenees](/assets/camping.png)

Most popular waymarked trails are broken down into recommended stages. These tend to fall around resupply points and break the hike down into sensible chunks that take into account ascents and descents. I use these stages as a template in helping me figure out how long the hike will take and where to look for places to camp.

<AppCard image='/assets/alltrails.png' name='AllTrails' />

**AllTrails** is my favourite tool for this. Most popular trails come as a _List_, a collection of maps for each stage. With AllTrails I can see the elevation profile and when I close up I can see water sources, campsites, bivouacs, cabanes and grocery shops. With AllTrails+ I can also view all this in 3D mode, which makes it much easier to get a visual of a section.

The recommended stages are usually designed for hut-to-hut hiking where you end the day at a refuge that you need to have booked in advance. I like to carry my own food and shelter and go with the flow when I'm out there so I'll instead prepare for this by making a copy of the trail and pinning the campsites, bivouacs and cabanes along the way. Then the night before I set off for a section, I would have a look at the map and choose a sensible spot to end of the day at. I'd also have a look for water sources coming up that day and if there's a dry section, I can be prepared.

![Custom map pinning the campsites, bivouacs and cabanes along the way](/assets/map.png)

With AllTrails+, I download my "custom" map with pinned points to use offline on my phone as my main source of navigation on trail.

<AppCard image='/assets/mapsme.png' name='maps.me' />

When I pass by a town I use **maps.me**'s offline maps for other points of interest such as grocery shops, ATMs, pharmacy‚Äôs etc. I'll download my "custom" map in a KML format, send this file to myself on WhatsApp and open it on mobile using maps.me. When I do this, I will find the map and any points under my bookmarks on the app.

## 3. Pick dates and book flights / train

  <AppCard image='/assets/gcal.png' name='Google Calendar' />
  <AppCard image='/assets/flo.png' name='Flo' />
</div>

Once I have a good understanding of the trail:

- I'll figure out how many days the hike will roughly take me. I'll add a day for arrival and another for departure. I may also add an extra day for contingency, depending on the difficulty of the hike.
- I research the nearest, most accessible airport or train station to the hike. If it's a popular hike this is usually well documented in blogs. If I land in a big city, I use **Citymapper** to figure out public transport. I find it much more reliable and easier to follow than Google maps.
- I then find a suitable slot in the month to fit my hike in and block the dates in my **Google Calendar**. I use **Flo** to help me find a window of time I won't be on my period. I use **Skyscanner** to check flight prices. Tuesday is almost always the cheapest day of the week to fly. I use **Deutsche Bahn** to check trains and buy an **Interrail** ticket because it's often cheaper than buying a return ticket and provides more flexibility and extra days to travel.

## 4. Book first night accommodation

I try and book a place for my first night of accommodation that's as close as possible to the trail head. This way, I don't need to spend as much time travelling to the trail head the next day and can set off as early as possible.

## 5. Plan transport to trail head & first day errands

I do all my **food shopping** at the trail head's town before I set off for my hike. I'll bring four freeze dried meals and a pack of energy bars from home in advance of the trip, just to take a bit of day 1 stress off. But this isn't necessary to do since the starting town for a trail is usually well equipped with hiking stores and supermarkets for hiker's to resupply at.

Since we can't take a can of pressurised gas on a plane or train, I'll do a quick check of some hiking stores I could buy a **screw top cartridge of fuel** from at the starting town. I check this using maps.me or ask on the trail's facebook group.

Lastly, I will take out **‚Ç¨100-200 cash** from an ATM before setting off. I will use my card where possible and keep cash as a backup.

## 6. Prepare gear

<AppCard image='/assets/airtable.png' name='Airtable' />

For your first hike, researching and purchasing gear will be the part that requires the most time, effort and money in your planning process. Since I've done loads of long distance hikes already, I've come to a point where my gear is in a pretty stable place and so this is the part that requires the least amount of prep time. I may **make a couple of small adjustments or gear upgrades before a hike** if I feel the need to. I really enjoy perfecting and optimising my gear and hiking rituals!

I keep an [up-to-date list of my gear](/blog/hiking-gear) along with info on how I use them here if you're interested. I used **Airtable** to record all this info.

## 7. Train üèãÔ∏è

I don't do any hiking specific training (I probably should). I usually up my CrossFit training and try to eat more food a month before the hike to build strength and muscle weight. CrossFit is made up of functional movements which includes weight lifting, sprinting, body weight exercises and gymnastics, so super all rounded!

There are a series of stretches and exercises that I do on the trail and as part of my evening routine, after setting up my tent. I learnt these from the legendary [Chase Mountains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQauQv4uDLs). They are so beneficial in helping improve my hip, ankle and knee mobility as well as preventing stiffness, pain and injury whilst on the trail. He also did a video on how to fix [IT band syndrome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGsOfRH4UEI) on trail, which has been a lifesaver for me. It's something I suffered with on trail before and it sucks (a lot!). Especially if, like me, you didn't know what you had at the time and thought it was knee pain.

Stay safe and listen to your body üíö.
