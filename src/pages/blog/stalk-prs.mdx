# How to get instant feedback on your design system

If you work on a design system you have the beautiful opportunity of being able to see how your users use and misuse your tool everyday!

Use that.

## Stalk 👏 those 👏 pull 👏 requests 👏

Get nosy 👃🏼 and all up in that codebase.

But don’t stalk to police 🚓 or shame those who use the design system incorrectly.

Instead approach it with **curiosity**.

*That’s your unfiltered feedback right there!*

Get excited when you see someone misuse your product 😁. There is an opportunity to learn here. It gets especially juicy 🧃 when you see a recurring pattern of misuse. Why do a lot of engineers hack our modal component or build their own? Maybe the component’s API is not flexible enough. Why are they using our global tokens and not our alias tokens? Do we even want our global tokens exposed to users? Is there an education piece missing around tokens?

## "They'll let us know when they struggle"

They won't. Or very few will. This could be for a number of reasons:

- The process to contribute to the design system appears an arduous, political or highly gate kept process.
- They have little capacity or incentive to get involved in design system work since their performance is measured on reaching their team's sprint goal.
- They don't even see their misuse as an issue or struggle unless they are blocked by it i.e. they are unable to hack around it to achieve what they need or find it's too difficult or time consuming to build their own version of the component.

## Your users are engineers not design system engineers

I've seen a lot of effort (and faith 🤲🏼) put into design system feedback surveys only to get back maybe a handful and with super generic comments. I've seen lots of time and energy wasted on hosting workshops to gather ideas from engineers, product managers and designers on how to improve the design system. It’s like asking customers to design their own car, **they are not the experts and it’s not their responsibility**. Their PRs already give you plenty of quantitative and qualitative insight into the areas that need your attention.

## "It's in the documentation though"

If your users are often asking questions already answered in the documentation, then your documentation is probably shit 💩. **Yes, documentation needs content designing too.** Just because the information is there, doesn't mean it's been presented in a way that's easily digestible, clear and in the format needed for your users.

There is also such a thing as too much documentation. Reduce the content! **What is actually used and needed here?** Good design is about managing attention.

Engineers are wonderfully lazy 🦥 but smart people. They'll do everything they can to not leave their IDE and have to read documentation. **Good design is first intuitive then discoverable**. Don't band aid the issue of bad component API design with more documentation for the component, prioritise the API. Reduce cognitive load needed to use your components APIs. You can do this by leveraging existing and familiar APIs such as HTML attributes and React's children prop for example. Sharing APIs across common components. Don't build these complex monolithic components that have abstracted everything into a list of props. Build composable components where the lower level components can be easily accessed.

## Designers make mistakes too

If you're a product engineer who finds themselves needing to build a slightly different version of a design system component or needing to use a custom value instead of a token to match the designs you were given... push back on the designer. Question them. Why does the design system version of this component not cut it here? Why can't we use the 12px spacing token here instead of a custom 10px here? There might be a good reason for it, there might not be.
