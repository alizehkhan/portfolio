# Every PR is unfiltered feedback on your design system

If you work on a design system you have the beautiful opportunity of being able to see your users struggle to use your tool everyday.

Leverage that.

**👀 STALK THOSE PULL REQUESTS 👀**

Get nosy 👃🏼 and all up in that codebase.

But don’t stalk to police 🚓 or shame those who use the design system incorrectly.

Instead approach it with CURIOSITY. That’s your unfiltered feedback right there!

Get excited when you see someone misuse your product 😁. There is an opportunity to learn here. It gets especially juicy 🧃 when you see a recurring pattern of misuse. Why do a lot of engineers hack our modal component? Maybe the component’s API is not intuitive / flexible enough? Why are they using global tokens and not the alias tokens? Do we want our global tokens to be exposed to users? Is there an education piece missing around tokens?

Engineers are wonderfully lazy smart people. Which means if they’re struggling to use your design system, they are more likely to just hack their way around it than to raise it as an issue. Especially when the process to contribute to the design system is an arduous or highly gate kept process. And let's be honest here, their performance is measured on reaching their team's sprint goal and have little capacity or incentive to take on design system tasks on top of that.

So stop wasting yours and your engineers time asking them to fill out your design system feedback form or attend a workshop to share their ideas. It’s like asking customers to design their own car, they are not the experts and it’s not their responsibility. Their PRs already give you quantitative and qualitative insight into the areas that need your attention.

Something important to keep in mind: **Good design is first intuitive then discoverable**. So don't band aid the issue of bad component API design with more documentation for the component (which a dev is unlikely to read), prioritise the API.

And if you're an engineer who finds themselves building your own slightly different version of a component, push back on the designer. Question them. Why does the design system version of this component not cut it here? There might be a good reason for it, there might not be.
