# Stop solving problems with a Confluence page

<Container>

You're in a meeting and someone says
You want to onboard people

No one who is new to accessibility (which are most frontend engineers and designers) are going to read the confluence page you lovingly spent time on regurgitating whats already largely available in many (and more interesting) formats on the web. Let’s face it, accessibility is not required or rewarded well enough in most organisations to be something designers and engineers would voluntarily engage with especially via a dry confluence page. I mean have you ever perused confluence in your own time on the job and felt engaged in the content you found on there? No. It’s confluence. We want to spend as little time on there as possible.

So how do we get people engaged enough in this topic to start to incorporate it into their workflow? Because throwing them a bunch of links to articles and talks on the web is likely going to overwhelm them. You need to engage with them the same amount of engagement you want from them.

I notice most frontend engineers and designers see accessibility as this seriously complicated black box of knowledge and so tend to either avoid it all together or rely entirely on the few that show interest in it because they think they know it all.

having workshops can bring it to life more and show people how it's not as deep and blackbox of a topic as it appears to be

Lack of documentation and information is not the problem here. We are not short on information out there on accessibility
