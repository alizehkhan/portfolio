# Minimalism helped meÂ unlearn

*My first impression of minimalism was probably like most peoples'. I thought it was an over-the-top concept. I was already a very organised person who didn't own much stuff and I didn't see the point in depriving myself of the things I needed. But none of that is actually what minimalism is about. Lets debunk some myths:*

---

## Myth 1â€Š-â€ŠMinimalism is about how much stuff youÂ own

A lot of people think minimalism is focused on the number of things you own and they picture it in its most extreme form: a room with wooden flooring, white walls, a bare mattress and plant in the corner. It's enough to put anyone off the concept or see it as unattainable. But this visual is more a symptom of adopting minimalism than what minimalism is actually about.

So wait, if minimalism isn't about stuff then why does this image always crop up?

Well firstly, algorithms favour the unusual and extremes because that's what grabs our attention. Here is a snippet of what my version of a minimalist desk setup is. Every minimalist's is different depending on their values.

**Minimalism is about intentionality. It's about living deliberately.** It's a mindset that influences our decision making and what we choose to own happens to be one of the most visible decisions we make in our lives and therefore the most tangible way to showcase minimalism online. There are a number of cognitive biases, our upbringing, social and cultural conditioning that play a heavy role in how we think, behave and make decisions in our life. Minimalism can teach us to overcome (or unlearn) some of these as we question whether something truly adds value to our life. This could be for

- the material possessions we own,
- how we choose to spend our time,
- the relationships we invest in,
- the apps we use,
- how we make a living etc.

It's exhausting at first, don't get me wrong. We are battling ways of thinking that are so entrenched we sometimes aren't aware they exist. And that's why I think minimalism initially and predominantly focuses on material things. Because of the abundance of things we own, it provides us with a training ground where we can ease into exposing these biases and unhealthy attachments. Through it, we discover how most of the material things we own don't serve us like we thought they did. This realisation can encourage us to question other choices we've made in our lives.

As I progressively let go of more things, I remember feeling a sense of liberation. Not because owning an extra t-shirt in my cupboard was holding me back from living my best life but because I felt a real sense of agency over my life again. I was reminded I have the power to prioritise what I spend _my_ time, money and energy on so that my life is spent on the activities and people that bring me joy and value.

Here are some of the biases a minimalist mindset helps us overcome:

### Sunk cost fallacy

The sunk cost fallacy is when we continue an action because of our past decisions (previously spent time, money, resources), rather than what will serve us in this present moment. So we stay in that shitty corporate job because we spent the last 6 years climbing that ladder and don't want to "start again". We keep transporting that ugly suit we'll never wear from house to house because, well, it was expensive and I _might_ wear it one day (no you won't). We build our lives around and punish our future based on past decisions.

### Endowment effect

This is a big one minimalism addresses. The tendency for us to overvalue things we own. People are more likely to keep a thing they currently own than to buy it if they didn't already have it. So again, this is about learning to identity and let go of the things that no longer serve us. This doesn't just apply to possessions but unhealthy relationships we hold onto.

### Social conditioning

<Quote author="The Wisdom of Anxiety, Sheryl Paul">One of the fastest ways to recognise that youâ€™re outsourcing your self-trust is to listen when the word "should" populates your thoughts and vocabulary.</Quote>

An example of this for me was when I realised the only reason I wore different clothes everyday was because of social conditioning. I put a lot of pressure on myself to curate a wardrobe that would paint me as the "well dressed one". I noticed 90% of the clothes in my cupboard I never even wore anyway because I'd always reach for my favourite t-shirt if it was clean. I do enjoy and appreciate good fashion but wearing the same thing everyday doesn't have to mean I have terrible fashion sense. It just means I get to wear my favourite t-shirt and jeans everyday and remove the decision on what to wear from my morning so I can spend that energy on other more important decisions / activities that bring me joy. This helped me realise most people are so focused on themselves they don't notice these things anyway. I've never had someone come up to me and say "Hey, you wore that t-shirt yesterday!". In fact, they only notice when you wear something different for a special event and then you get lots of compliments for your outfit, however basic it is ðŸ˜‚.

### Cultural conditioning

A lot of us are sold the message that to attain happiness we need to follow the timeline of the culture: do well in school (even if itâ€™s opposed to your learning style), have a lot of friends (even if youâ€™re an introvert and prefer one or two close friends), attend university when youâ€™re 18, party hard (even if thatâ€™s not your style), and then find a great job, get married, buy a house, get a dog, have 1.7 babies, climb the corporate ladder, buy a bigger house and more expensive car, retire. Unless you consciously choose against the prescriptions of the culture, youâ€™re likely to fall into the sheep line and blindly follow this even if it doesn't flow for you.

## Myth 2: "A minimalist? Oh I love Marie Kondo'sÂ show!"

Yes that's right folks. Marie Kondo is not a minimalist and nor does she claim to be. Having a colour coded and categorised room full of shit does not take away the fact that it's still a room full of shit you don't need. Spending hours folding, thanking, and hugging items of clothing is also just reenforcing the unhealthy attachment we have to material things.

Ok, now that's out the way, let's move onto myth 3.

## Myth 3: Minimalists can't own expensive things

Minimalism isn't deprivation, in fact, it's the opposite. When you become more intentional with what you own, you free up more time and money to invest in the things that you truly value, love and use.

I buy less but better quality and durable things. I spend a lot of time cycling round Berlin and so I spent money and time researching a beautiful bike I'd enjoy riding. I spend a lot of time on my laptop, coding and designing, so I own a Macbook.

What minimalism urges you do is to not tye up your life, self worth and respect to material possessions. One of my favourite quotes is:
