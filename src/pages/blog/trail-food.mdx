# Trail food

ðŸš§ Post under construction

Food is a mixture of nutrients that produce energy for the body, stimulate growth, and maintain life. The six classes of nutrients are carbohydrates, protein, fats, vitamins, minerals and water.

Of these six nutrients, only three provide calories in the form of energy for the body:

- 1g of **carbohydrate** = 4 calories
- 1g of **protein** = 4 calories
- 1g of **fat** = 9 calories

## Storage

I try to store heat-sensitive items like chocolate, cheese, salami deeper in my pack, not in an outer pocket where direct sun can beat down on it. Crushable items like chips or fresh fruit that could bruise I keep at the top of my pack.

If I can't close a food package securely, chances are it will explode in my pack and make a big mess. I repackage food in Ziploc bags to reduce bulk and have the ability to reseal them.

## Rubbish

Take all your rubbish with you on the trail. This includes biodegradable material not native to the hiking area, like banana or orange peels. Plastic Ziploc bags work well to hold handfuls of rubbish.
