# Trail food

<Container>

*I am a snobby hiker when it comes to food. I'll do anything I can to avoid cooking! Trying the local dishes and socialising during meals is also often the most enjoyable moments for me during my hikes, so I never skimp on that experience. So with that in mind here is a bit of insight into my food-related habits whilst hiking*

---

## Nutrition

Food is a mixture of six classes of nutrients: carbohydrates, protein, fats, vitamins, minerals and water. Of these six nutrients, only three provide calories in the form of energy for the body:

- 1g of **carbohydrate** = 4 calories
- 1g of **protein** = 4 calories
- 1g of **fat** = 9 calories

You will burn a shit tonne of calories whilst hiking so it's important to keep your body fuelled.

## Resupply options

### Grocery stores / bakeries / restaurants

When hiking in Europe you'll pass by a little town or village at least every 3/4 days. When I'm there, I stock up at the grocery store, enjoy a meal at a restaurant and stop by the bakery before I set off again.

### Refuges

There is also the option to rely on refuge dinners and picnics along the way. Dinner is usually ~€20 and a picnic / packed lunch to take the next day is ~€15. If you want to do this, call the refuge in advance to book a spot for dinner so you know there is space for you when you arrive and they know to prepare enough food.

I almost always go for this option for dinner if I am camping outside a refuge. I love it! I get to enjoy a prepared hot meal, dessert and socialise with other hikers after a long day of walking. It also means I don't need to carry dinner those nights so my pack is a little lighter.

## Storage

I try to store heat-sensitive items like chocolate, cheese, salami deeper in my pack, not in an outer pocket where the sun can beat down on it. Crushable items like crisps or fresh fruit that can bruise, I keep at the top of my pack.

If I can't close a food package securely, chances are it will explode in my pack and make a big mess. I repackage food in Ziploc bags to reduce bulk and have the ability to reseal them.

## Rubbish

Take all your rubbish with you on the trail. This includes biodegradable material not native to the hiking area, like banana or orange peels. Plastic Ziploc bags work well to hold handfuls of rubbish.
