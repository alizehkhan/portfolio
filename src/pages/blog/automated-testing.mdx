# Automated accessibility testing

ðŸš§ Post under construction ðŸš§

We can leverage tooling and automated tests during our development workflow to help us:

- uncover "low-hanging fruit" type accessibility issues
- improve accessibility test coverage
- develop accessible user flows and components more efficiently
- avoid introducing technical debt.

## Axe

[`axe-core`](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) is an open source accessibility rules engine that can be used to empower linters, browser extensions and automated testing tools like `jest` and `cypress` to uncover up to 57% of WCAG issues.

## Linter

**Up to 25% of WCAG issues** can be caught whilst coding. [axe Linter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=deque-systems.vscode-axe-linter) is a VSCode extension that uses a subset of `axe-core`'s rules engine to catch things like:

- Missing `alt` attribute for images
- Missing `label` for inputs
- Missing accessible text for buttons and links
- Improper use of `tabindex` (positive integer)
- Improper use of ARIA

Linters are an easy way to catch some low-hanging fruit and a great first step to raising awareness of accessibility among an engineering team. When working on a codebase with multiple contributors, we can install [`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y), activate the plugin and use it's `recommended` (or `strict`) rule set in the `.eslintrc.json` like so:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["jsx-a11y"],
  "extends": ["plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended"]
}
```

Then using [`lint-staged`](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) and [`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky) we can enforce these rules by running the `eslint` script pre-commit.

## Browser extension

**Up to 57% of WCAG issues** can be caught by in-browser testing tools. [Axe Devtools Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd) can scan a page for things like:

- Insufficient text to background contrast ratios
- Missing or incorrect usage of headings

I prefer axe Devtools to Chrome's Lighthouse as it doesn't reload the page, so any local state, like an open modal, can be preserved when testing.

The Pro version of Axe Devtools includes a series of guided tests that assists you in assessing the structure, images, interactive elements, forms and modals on a page. This can bring your accessibility test coverage to 80%.

## Unit testing

Unit testing is helpful for component-specific accessibility behaviour. This is especially important when building design system components that will be used across the site. I use the [ARIA patterns guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) as acceptance criteria and unit test specs for the component I'm building.

## UI testing

I use [`cypress-axe`](https://github.com/component-driven/cypress-axe) to run the `axe-core` checks as part of my UI testing.

Install the dependencies

```shell
yarn add -D axe-core cypress-axe
```

Add the axe commands to `cypress/support/index.ts` file so they are available to use on the `cy` object.

```typescript
import "cypress-axe";
```

Now testing can be as simple as: visiting the page, injecting axe and checking the page's accessibility.

```typescript
describe("Home page", () => {
  it("should be accessible", () => {
    cy.visit("/");
    cy.injectAxe();
    cy.checkA11y();
  });
});
```
