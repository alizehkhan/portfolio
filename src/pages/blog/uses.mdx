# My list of apps, extensions, configs

*I enjoy reading other people's lists of apps, extensions, configs etc so I thought I'd share my own üòÅ. I will try to keep this up to date as and when things change but this system has been pretty stable for me for a while.*

---

## Apps

I used to be a real productivity app junkie, discovering and downloading apps from Product Hunt that solved problems I never had üòÖ. I'm now super minimalist when it comes to my digital setup. I'm not a personal fan of elaborate productivity systems like bullet journalling and custom built notion dashboards. I like to keep things as simple as possible. The system has to work for me, not the other way round. I will only introduce an extra layer of complexity like another app or a folder structure if it saves more time and effort than the additional maintenance required.

When it comes to a notes and lists app, the most important thing for me is an app that's quick to start up. Apple's native Notes and Reminders apps are lightning fast to load when I need to quickly jot something down, they sync across my devices and have a really simple UI. The only thing I don't like is there is no history tracking on the Notes app so you can't revert back to an old version of the note which can be a little dangerous if you accidentally delete something. When it comes to lists, I only have two:

- **My grocery list:** with the Reminders app, I can easily check and uncheck items as and when I purchase them or need to restock.
- **My to do list:** This is for everything else that needs to be done. I don't like having too many lists because it makes it harder to keep track and prioritise things when they are spread out across the place.
