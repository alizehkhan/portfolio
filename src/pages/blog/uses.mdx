# My list of apps, extensions, configs etc.

*I enjoy reading other people's lists of apps, extensions, configs etc so I thought I'd share my own üòÅ. I will try to keep this up to date as and when things change but this system has been pretty stable for me for a while.*

---

## Apps

I'm very minimalist when it comes to my digital setup. I'm not a fan of these elaborate productivity systems you see YouTube influencers sharing. I keep things as simple as possible. The system has to work for me, not the other way round. I will only introduce an extra layer of complexity like another app or a folder structure if it saves more time and effort than the additional maintenance required.

When it comes to a notes and lists app, the most important thing for me is an app that's quick to load when I open it up on my device and need to jot something down. Apple's native Notes and Reminders apps are lightning fast to start up. It also syncs across my devices and has a really simple UI. The only thing I don't like is there is no history tracking on the Notes app so you can't revert back to an old version of the note which can be a little dangerous if you accidentally delete something. When it comes to lists, I only have two:

- **My grocery list:** I like with the Reminders app that I can easily check and uncheck items as and when I purchase them or need to restock.
- **My to do list:** This is for everything else that needs to be done. I don't like having too many lists because it makes it harder to keep track and prioritise things when they are spread out across the place.

So here's my app list...
