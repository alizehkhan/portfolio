# My ruthlessly simple email setup

## I have 1 email address.

My Gmail is my only email address. I love its beautifully minimalist UI and how it seamlessly integrates with my Google Calendar, Drive and Chrome.

Logging in is a breeze, especially with Google Single Sign On. And if I ever need another email for some reason (like for a free trial 😏 or to know which service sold my data to a 3rd party), I can add a `+` and any word I want to at the end of my email address eg. `myemail+amazon@gmail.com`, and it will also reach my inbox.

## I treat my Inbox like a to-do list.

When an email arrives, it remains in my inbox until I have dealt with it:

- ✅ Read
- ✅ Replied, or
- ✅ Taken the action required

Then I will either:

- 📥 Archive it, if I think I'll need to refer to it again at some point, or
- 🗑 Delete it.

Having an email sitting in the way of achieving Inbox zero is usually enough motivation for me to deal with it promptly.

## I hide everything except Inbox and All Mail.

I keep it beautifully minimalist and distraction free.

## No labels, folders, stars, categories and what not.

I don't spend time organising my emails. When I need to find an email I use the search bar. If someone sends me an important attachment, I'll save it in a folder on Google drive. If I have information I regularly need to refer to in an email, I'll transfer that info to Apple Notes, Airtable or another more appropriate tool than email.

## I unsubscribe.

When a newsletter becomes more of a chore to read I unsubscribe instead of hoarding them thinking I'll read them some day.
