# “It clutters up the UI”

<Container>

I once asked a designer why they put the hints for their input fields in tooltips. They replied: *"Because they clutter up the UI”*.

This isn't the first time I've heard a designer say this.

When designers are focused on reducing clutter and making things look minimalist, we end up with products like these 👇

## My flat's “clutter free” intercom

Sleek and modern, right!? 💅🏼

One of simplest home devices turned into the most frustrating experience because the designer was more focused on having a minimalist aesthetic. I'm not joking when I say it took me months to figure out how this thing worked because I could only test it when someone rang the bell.

The biggest challenge I faced was figuring out whether the key button should be held down or short pressed to unlock the door. The feedback from pressing the button (a beep and a short flash) had an abruptness to it which made it sound like an error or lock in this case. So I tried long pressing expecting the device would follow the convention of other intercoms. That didn't work. And because their mic shuts off when I press the key button the only feedback I have is creepily watching them struggle in silence through the camera as they try and open the door.

I also have no clue what buttons 1️⃣ and 2️⃣ do. Is it an option to open the door for 1 or 2 seconds? Is there a door 2 🚪 I don’t know about? Who knows? But I sure won’t be experimenting with this "feature" in the 10 second window of time I have when a delivery person rings my bell.

## My flat's “clutter free” thermostat

What are these numbers? Do they refer to the intensity of the heat? Do they map to a certain temperature 🌡️?

Why is it that when I scroll past the dot ⚫️, I feel and hear a click? Does that mean it’s on? If it does, then what does 2 + 3 mean if it’s before the click at the dot?

Also sidenote: shouldn't the snowflake ❄️ (which I assume means off) be at 0 not 1?

How do I know it's working? It's hard to tell with floor heating until the room is heated. There's no indicator or temperature to tell me what's happening.

## An interface is there to be used

So why am I ranting to you about my beautiful but frustrating home devices?

Because I want to make the point that an interface is there to be used not looked at. Our users are there to complete a task. As designers our job is to make that as easy and efficient for them as possible.

So coming back to the earlier example, it's not "clutter" if the user needs the hints in order to complete the form correctly.

Good design is content-driven not aesthetics-driven.

Respect people's time. Create useful things.
