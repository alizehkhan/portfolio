# “It clutters up the UI”

<Container>

I once asked a designer why they put the hints for their input fields in tooltips. They replied: *"Because they clutter up the UI”*.

This isn't the first time I've heard a designer say this.

When designers are focused on reducing clutter and making things look minimalist, we end up with products like these 👇

## My flat's “clutter free” intercom

Sleek and modern, right!? 💅🏼

One of simplest home devices turned into the most frustrating experience because the designer was focused on having a minimalist aesthetic. It took me months to figure out how this thing worked because I only had the 10 second windows of time someone would ring my bell to test it out.

Here's how an intercom usually works: you hold the key 🔑 button down, the door makes a buzzing noise which you can pick up from the mic, letting you know you've unlocked the door. When you let go of the button, you know the door is locked again.

The designer of this intercom was clearly bored and decided to throw that convention out the window.

When I press the key 🔑 button I hear a beep, both our mics shut off so I can't hear the door unlocking or the person. The button lights up for a moment but it's not correlated to the time the door is unlocked for. I think it lights up to let me know the button was successfully pressed since the designer didn't leverage the affordance an actual button provides to maintain their minimalist aesthetic 🙄. So I have no feedback at all on whether the bloody door is open or not which is literally the sole purpose of this device.

It’s been over 2 years and I still don’t know what buttons 1️⃣ and 2️⃣ do. Is it an option to open the door for 1 or 2 seconds? Is there a door 2 🚪 I don’t know about? Who knows? But I sure won’t be experimenting with this in the 10 second window of time I have when a delivery person rings my bell. It's too risky.

## My flat's “clutter free” thermostat

What are these numbers? Do they refer to the intensity of the heat? Do they map to a certain temperature 🌡️?

Why is it that when I scroll past the dot ⚫️, I feel and hear a click? Does that mean it’s on? If it does, then what does 2 + 3 mean if it’s before the click at the dot?

Also sidenote: shouldn't the snowflake ❄️ (which I assume means off) be at 0 not 1?

How do I know it's working? It's hard to tell with floor heating until the room is heated. There's no indicator or temperature to tell me what's happening.

## An interface is there to be used

So why am I ranting to you about my beautiful but frustrating home devices?

Because I want to make the point that an interface is there to be used not looked at. Our users are there to complete a task. As designers our job is to make that as easy and efficient for them as possible.

So coming back to the earlier example, it's not "clutter" if the user needs the hints in order to complete the form correctly. Good design is content-driven not aesthetics-driven.
