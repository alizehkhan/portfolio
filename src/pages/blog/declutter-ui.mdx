# “It will clutter up the UI”

<Container>

I once asked a designer why they put the descriptions for their input fields in tooltips ❓ and they said: *"Because they clutter up the UI”*.

😔

This isn't the first time I've heard a designer say this.

When designers are focused on reducing clutter and making things look “minimalist”, we end up with products like these 👇

## My flat's “clutter free” intercom

Sleek and modern, right!? 💅🏼

One of simplest home devices turned into the most frustrating experience because the designer didn’t want to “clutter up" the interface. I’m not joking when I say it took me a couple of months to figure out how this thing worked.

This thing is so “clutter free” it lacks important signifiers and feedback I need to be able to actually use the thing and understand what's happening.

It’s been over 2 years and I still don’t know what buttons 1️⃣ and 2️⃣ do. Is it an option to open the door for 1 or 2 seconds? Is there a door 2 🚪 I don’t know about? Who knows? But I sure won’t be experimenting with this in the 10 second window of time I have when a delivery person rings my bell.

## My flat's “clutter free” thermostat

What are these numbers? Do they refer to the intensity of the heat? Do they map to a certain temperature 🌡️?

Why is it that when I scroll past the dot ⚫️, I feel and hear a click? Does that mean it’s on? If it does, then what does 2 + 3 mean if it’s before the click at the dot?

Also shouldn't the snowflake ❄️ (which I assume means off) be at zero not 1.

How do I even know it's working, it's really hard to tell with floor heating. There's no indicator or temperature to tell me what's happening.

## An interface is there to be used

So why am I ranting to you about my home devices?

Because I want to make the point that an interface is there to be used not experienced. Our users are there to complete a task. As designers our job is to make that as easy and efficient for them as possible.

So coming back to the earlier example, it's not "clutter" if the user needs the description in order to complete the form correctly. Good design prioritises content not aesthetics.
