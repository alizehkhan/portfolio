# “It will clutter up the UI”

<Container>

I once asked a designer why they hid the description for an input field in a tooltip and they said: *"I don’t want to clutter up the UI”*.

😔 This isn't the first time I've heard a designer say this.

When designers are focused on reducing clutter and making things look “minimalist”, we end up with products like these 👇

## This is my flat's “clutter free” intercom

It's pretty 💅🏼, right?

One of simplest home devices turned into the most frustrating experience 😤 because the designer didn’t want to “clutter up" the interface. I’m not joking when I say it took me a couple of months to figure out how this thing worked.

This thing is so “clutter free” it lacks important signifiers and feedback I need to be able to actually use the thing and understand what's going on.

It’s been over 2 years and I still don’t know what buttons 1️⃣ and 2️⃣ do. Is it an option to open the door for 1 or 2 seconds? Is there a door 2 I don’t know about? Who knows? But I sure won’t be experimenting with this in the 10 second window of time I have when a delivery person rings my bell.

So I now see this key light up

## Here is another one. My “clutter free” thermostat

What are these numbers? Do they refer to the intensity of the heat? Do they map to a certain temperature?

Why is it that when I scroll past 3, I feel and hear a click, does that mean it’s on? If it does, then what does 1 + 2 mean if it’s before the click at 3?

How do I even know it's working right now? There's no indicator or temperature to tell me what's happening right now.

As a minimalist, I get questions like why do you have 2 monitors if you're a minimalist? Because I need it to be productive at my job. Minimalism is not about deprivation. It’s about being INTENTIONAL with what need and don't need. So if you are a designer please be intentional with what you hide to reduce clutter. And if you’re hiding something in a tooltip because it’s not that important, then maybe consider removing it entirely.

When you make it flat you lose the affordance the physical object can communicate to the user.
I press it. I hear a short beep
