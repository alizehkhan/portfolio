# Manual accessibility testing

**🚧 Post under construction 🚧**

*Tackling accessibility can feel overwhelming and it's pretty much impossible to have a 100% accessible website. So instead of creating a guide that tries to boil the ocean, I thought I would share the manual testing rituals I've managed to incorporate into my development workflow. I'll try to keep this up to date as I learn more.*

*If you've never used the screen reader on your Mac, my hope is that by the end of this post you will have at least pressed <Key>command</Key> + <Key>F5</Key>. I mean you could even press it now if you want 🤷.*

## To learn

Not everyone uses a mouse to navigate a website, so here are the commands and tools I've learnt to use on my Mac to test user flows and components for keyboard and screen reader user.

### ⌨️ Keyboard user commands

<Key>tab</Key> to focus on the next interactive element.

<Key>shift</Key> + <Key>tab</Key> to focus on the previous interactive element.

<Key>↑</Key>/<Key>↓</Key>/<Key>←</Key>/<Key>→</Key> to cycle through related controls
such a dropdown list or radio group.

<Key>spacebar</Key> to toggle states (eg. a checkbox) or move down the page

<Key>enter</Key> to interact.

### 🔉 Screen reader user commands

<Key>command</Key> + <Key>F5</Key> to activate MacOS's built-in screen reader, Voiceover.

<Key>control</Key> + <Key>option</Key> + <Key>←</Key>/<Key>→</Key> to move between
elements

<Key>control</Key> + <Key>option</Key> + <Key>U</Key> to open up the rotor. Then
<Key>←</Key>/<Key>→</Key> to navigate through the lists available eg. landmarks,
headers, links etc.

### 🌳 Accessibility tree

## My checklist

### Structure

1. Are any heading tags misused?
2. Are there any headings missing?
3. Does each heading accurately describe the content that immediately follows it?
4. Are there any list tags being misused?
5. Are there any lists missing?
6. Does the page title accurately describe the purpose of the page?

### Interactive elements

1. Is the tabbing order logical and intuitive?
2. Are there any interactive elements missing from the tab sequence?
3. Is the keyboard focus indicator always visible?
4. Can you navigate behind or around an element that should be trapping focus like a modal?
5. Are all the states (eg. `disabled`, `expanded`, `selected`, `pressed`, `checked`, `readonly`) that apply to the interactive element correct?
6. Select the role which accurately conveys the element's purpose.
7. Does the accessible text for the interactive element accurately describe the element's meaning?

### Images

1. Do the decorative images have a null `alt` attribute and the decorative SVGs have an `aria-hidden=true`?
2. Does the alt text accurately describe what the image is and what it’s for?
3. Are there any images that contain text?
