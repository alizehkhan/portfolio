# Manual accessibility testing

**🚧 Post under construction 🚧**

*Tackling accessibility can feel overwhelming and it's pretty much impossible to have a 100% accessible website. So instead of creating a guide that tries to boil the ocean, I thought I would share the manual testing rituals I've managed to incorporate into my development workflow. I'll try to keep this up to date as I learn more.*

*If you've never used the screen reader on your Mac, my hope is that by the end of this post you will have at least pressed <Key>command</Key> + <Key>F5</Key>. I mean you could even press it now if you want 🤷.*

## To learn

Not everyone uses a mouse to navigate a website, so here are the commands and tools I've learnt to use on my Mac to test user flows and components for keyboard and screen reader user.

### ⌨️ Keyboard user commands

<Key>tab</Key> to focus on the next interactive element.

<Key>shift</Key> + <Key>tab</Key> to focus on the previous interactive element.

<Key>↑</Key>/<Key>↓</Key>/<Key>←</Key>/<Key>→</Key> to cycle through related controls
such a dropdown list or radio group.

<Key>spacebar</Key> to toggle states (eg. a checkbox) or move down the page

<Key>enter</Key> to interact.

### 🔉 Screen reader user commands

<Key>command</Key> + <Key>F5</Key> to activate MacOS's built-in screen reader, Voiceover.

<Key>control</Key> + <Key>option</Key> + <Key>←</Key>/<Key>→</Key> to move between
elements

<Key>control</Key> + <Key>option</Key> + <Key>U</Key> to open up the rotor. Then
<Key>←</Key>/<Key>→</Key> to navigate through the lists available eg. landmarks,
headers, links etc.

### 🌳 Accessibility tree

The browser takes the DOM tree and modifies it into a semantic version that is useful to assistive technology. This modified tree is called the Accessibility Tree. Any elements such as a `div` used only for visual presentation are omitted from the tree.

## My checklist

### Structure

- Open up the screen reader rotor <Key>control</Key> + <Key>option</Key> + <Key>U</Key> and check the headings list for the page. Are there any headings missing or heading tags being misused?
- Check that each heading accurately describes the content that immediately follows it.
- Check that no list tags are being misused or are missing.
- Check that the page title (shown in the tab) accurately describes the purpose of the page.

### Interactive elements

<Key>tab</Key> through the page and check:

- The tabbing order is logical and intuitive.
- There are no interactive elements missing from the tab sequence
- The keyboard focus indicator is always visible.
- You are unable to navigate behind or around an element that should be trapping focus like a modal.
- The states (eg. `disabled`, `expanded`, `selected`, `pressed`, `checked`, `readonly`) that apply to the interactive element are correct. Check these are announced correctly by the screen reader.
- If there is an `aria-label` for an interactive element such as an icon button, this should accurately describe the element's meaning. Although we should try our best to avoid using icon only buttons.

### Images

- Any decorative `img` has an `alt=""` attribute.
- Any decorative `svg` has an `aria-hidden=true`.
- Any `alt` text accurately describes what the image is and what it’s for.
- No images contain text as these would not be picked up by assistive technologies.

### Forms

My go to resources for building accessible forms are adamsilver.io and gov.uk's design system.

### Other components

Each component has it's own list of acceptance criteria that needs to be checked. Some of these can be covered using tooling and automated testing. It's important to check these components are implemented and integrated into the page in an accessible way.
