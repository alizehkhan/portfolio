# Manual accessibility testing

*Tackling accessibility can feel overwhelming and it's pretty much impossible to have a 100% accessible website. So instead of creating a guide that tries to boil the ocean, I thought I would share the manual testing rituals I've managed to incorporate into my development workflow. I'll try to keep this up to date as I learn more.*

*If you've never used the screen reader on your Mac, my hope is that by the end of this post you will have at least pressed <Key>command</Key> + <Key>F5</Key>. I mean you could even press it now if you want ü§∑.*

## Commands and tools for testing

Not everyone uses a mouse to navigate a website, so here are the commands and tools I've learnt to use on my Mac to test user flows and components for assistive technology users.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard user commands

<Key>tab</Key> to focus on the next interactive element.

<Key>shift</Key> + <Key>tab</Key> to focus on the previous interactive element.

<Key>‚Üë</Key>/<Key>‚Üì</Key>/<Key>‚Üê</Key>/<Key>‚Üí</Key> to cycle through related controls
such a dropdown list or radio group.

<Key>spacebar</Key> to toggle states (eg. for a checkbox) or move down the page

<Key>enter</Key> to interact.

### üîâ Screen reader user commands

_Screen readers are software applications that render text and image content as speech or braille output._

<Key>command</Key> + <Key>F5</Key> to activate MacOS's built-in screen reader, Voiceover.

<Key>control</Key> + <Key>option</Key> + <Key>‚Üê</Key>/<Key>‚Üí</Key> to move between
elements

<Key>control</Key> + <Key>option</Key> + <Key>U</Key> to open up the rotor. Then
<Key>‚Üê</Key>/<Key>‚Üí</Key> to navigate through the lists available eg. landmarks,
headers, links etc.

### üå≥ Accessibility tree

Assistive technologies use the browser's accessibility tree as the API to interact with a site. For each node in the DOM, the browser determines if the node is semantically "interesting" and if so, adds it to the accessibility tree. All HTML elements, except `div` and `span` come with built-in semantic properties such as:

- **Role** - describes the purpose of an element e.g. `checkbox`, `list`, `table`.
- **State** - describes the state of an interactive element e.g. `checked`, `disabled`, `expanded`, `readonly`;
- **Name** - an element's accessible name which can be derived from its content, an attribute such as `alt`, `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `title`, or an associated element eg. an input's `label`.

Since `div` and `span` are the only HTML elements that have no semantic properties, they are omitted from the tree unless . These should be used only as  wrappers for styling or to build custom components with roles that cannot be replaced by a native HTML element.

_To view a site's accessibility tree click on the `Accessibility` tab in Chrome's devtools, and check `Enable full-page accessibility tree`. You will then be able to toggle on and off between the DOM and the accessibility tree using the button that's appeared in the top right corner of the DOM._

## My checklist

### Structure

- Open up the screen reader rotor <Key>control</Key> + <Key>option</Key> + <Key>U</Key> and check the headings list for the page. Are there any headings missing or heading tags being misused?
- Check that each heading accurately describes the content that immediately follows it.
- Check that the page title (shown in the browser's tab) accurately describes the purpose of the page.
- Check that any `div` or `span` elements that have semantic meaning are replaced with semantic elements or given an appropriate `aria-role` attribute.
- Ensure that any elements with an `aria-role` attribute cannot be replaced with an [equivalent HTML element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/structural-roles/).

### Interactive elements

<Key>tab</Key> through the page and check:

- The tabbing order is logical and intuitive.
- There are no interactive elements missing from the tab sequence
- The keyboard focus indicator is always visible.
- For modals, you are unable to navigate behind or around an element that should be trapping focus.

Use the accessibility tree to check:

- The states (eg. `disabled`, `expanded`) that apply to the interactive element are correct.
- If there is an `aria-label` for an interactive element such as an icon button, this should accurately describe the element's meaning. Although we should try our best to avoid using icon only buttons.

### Images

- Any decorative `svg` has an `aria-hidden=true` so they can be ignored by assistive technologies.
- Any decorative `img` has an `alt=""`. To determine whether it's decorative, ask yourself: _If the image was removed, would the user still get all the information from the page?_
- If an image is helpful in interacting with or understanding a page, the `alt` text needs to be appropriate. The content of this would depend on the context.
- If there is text in an image, this text needs to be included in the `alt` text.

### Forms

My go-to resources for building accessible forms are [Adam Silver](https://adamsilver.io)'s content and [GOV.UK's design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) components and patterns. Here are a couple of things to check:

- If a field is part of a group of related fields ie. each field does not make sense on its own, then it should grouped using `<fieldset>`.
- There a visual indication (that doesn't solely rely on colour alone) to distinguish which fields are required and/or optional.
- When you leave a `required` field empty, then submit the form, an error message should show up.
- Colour alone should not be used to indicate errors.
- Error messages are informative enough to fill out the field correctly. Ideally the hint text is informative enough to mitigate the error in the first place.

### Other components

I use [ARIA patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) to see what I need to test for components like modals, tooltips, accordions, switches etc to ensure they are accessible. Each component has it's own list of acceptance criteria. Even if a component has come from a design system, it's important to check these components have been implemented and integrated into the page in an accessible way.
