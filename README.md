# Hiya, I'm Alizeh 🌳

🎒 Nerdy about intuitive, inclusive and beautiful interfaces, design systems, and clean code 🧼. I'm both a frontend engineer and product designer, so a bit of a Swiss Army knife for product. I am also an avid hiker ⛰️, CrossFitter 🏋️ and minimalist <i>(so pretty much anything with a cult-like following it seems 🤔).</i>
